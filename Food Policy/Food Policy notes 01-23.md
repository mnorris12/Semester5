- Events (what just happened): react
- Patterns/trends (what trend shave there been over time?) anticipate
- Underlying structures (what has influenced the patters? What are the relationships between parts?)

Systems Thinking - "An interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something"

Systems Approaches
- Embrace the complexity!
- Analyze the past and gain clarity on root causes of problems, the patterns of events and underlying structures contexts, acknowledge mental models 
3 different types of food systems:
- Traditional/informal/small holder farming and food systems
- intermediate/transitioning/modernizing
	- informal and expanding
	- emerging and diversifying
	- modernizing ad formalizing
- Industrialized/consilidated "modern"

Traditional Food Systems:
- about 1.5 to 2 billion people - rural communities 
- Smallholder agriculture, family-based farms"
	- supply chains shorter, less complex, domestic 
	- Low input, diversified; productivity varies (low-high)
	- Mostly staple crops and household needs
	- Surplus and other food traded in small, local markets

Transitioning 
- about 4 to 5 billion people
- blend of small and mid-size production systems
	- increasing specialization and use of inputs 
	- supply chains local, but increasingly global
	- increasing infrastructure, governance, and grown in supermarkets
- Challenges
	- Production shocks (weather)
	- international price and trade issues 
	- More susceptible to shocks (infrastructure, governance)
	- undernutrition and diet-related disease
Education beyond individual health
- food literacy - nutrition, individual focus
Industry and Supply chains: values-based procurement
- Restaurants and food service account for half of all dollars spent on food in the US
  - Good food purchasing programs (GFPP)
	  - local economies
	  - health
	  - valued workforce
	  - animal welfare
	  - environmental sustainability
	  - racial equity

Influencing food and nutrition policy in the US
- 15 federal agencies, 28 house and senate committees
- Hundreds of state and local health departments
- Thousands of local, state, and federal policies
