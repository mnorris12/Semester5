	1. Implementation is a detailed process that requires attention to ensure policies work
4. Use proactive research-policy translation strategies


Linkage between researchers and policymakers
- understand the complexities and drivers in decision making
- communicate information more effectively
- educate staffers on science
- conduct policy-relevant research
- improve training in translation and dissemination
- Cultivate political champions

Conclusions
- policy change is critical to address leading food systems problems
- Key principles are relevant for academic, practitioners, etc.
- Principles relevant for policy change at the federal, state, and local levels, and for public policies and private/institutional policies

#### Assessing Policymakers: Case Study

Executive Branch:
- President, vice president, cabinet
	- Elected - Member of Congress
	- Appointed - Staff director 
Legislative Branch
- Congress, Senate, House of Reps
	- Elected - Mayor
	- Appointed - health commisioner
Judicial
- Supreme court, other federal courts
	- Elected - elected judge
	- Appointed - appointed judge

For policy member (what branch are they under, how did they gain their power?)

- What is the basis of legal authority to set policy? If no good answer, might not be the right policymaker. Possible answer: 
	- Constitution... which provision?
	- Statute(law) - which provision?

Constraints - Formal and Informal
- Formal
	- The limits of the governing law... usually not fruitful to ask sm1 to do something they are not legally permitted to do 
- Informal
	- Someone else must approve even if not required (health commissioner - mayor)
	- special interests 
	- popular opinion
	- media response

For the case study
- Formal: being sued over right to travel

Purpose of policy writing: 
- Facilitate needed policy change
- help the person who reads the memo or letter to make and defend a decision
- The person will not be mad at you afterwards - counteragruments and potential fall out

Framing: 
- connect specific policy memo to values and principles that matter to the audience
	- What are things they have and haven't supported
	- Who do they get funding from

Summarize: 
 - at the start of the memo in a box
 - at the start of a letter in a separate section
 -  in the cover email 
  - clear, succinct 

Organization: 
- logical flow
- Footnotes 
- addresses objections? Yes helps audience
	- direct or indirect
- Figures and tables? only if super-clear 
- conclusion? Yes. Bring it back together

Make it look good
- white space
- enter the full address of a letter, even for drafts
- convey competence and master of subject 
- footnote statistics and data

Tone: 
- direct
- persuasive
- accessible 

Additional tips
- please no slashes
	- and/or
	- his/her
- Although "although" is a common word, it misdirects the reader in a sentence and should pretty much never be used. 

Why do we need a problem statement?
- Establishes that there is a problem that needs to be addressed
- helps to narrow large public health topics

How to refine the problem: 
- Pick a topic: 
	- Task-driven: may be given a broad topic by your boss, a partner or a client
	- Goal driven: may have a public policy area you are interested  in addressing (more interative)
- Rdfine a specific problem
	- think about deficit and excess
	- what is the real problem?
	- make sure the problem is appropriate for public policy response
- Make sure it is presented in a way that's relevant and urgent to the policymaker 
- Gather evidence 

How to refine the problem (2)
- Goal: get the policymaker's attention
	- issue/problem
		- may also include consequences of the problem
	- context/population
	- magnitude of problem
		- use numbers!

How to write a problem statement
- have a problem and driver
- incorporate geography
- don't put a solution in the problem statement

Keep it short
- 1-2 sentences 
- This is your "hook"
- The scope of the problem and magnitude you describe should match the level of the decision maker

Problem Statement Summary
- Goal: get the policymaker's attention!

Elements of a policy question
- Should include assume of the following elemetns: 
	- policymakers
	- setting
