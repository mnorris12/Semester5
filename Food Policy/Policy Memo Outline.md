 - 89 different WIC programs administered by states, territories, and tribal governments
 - Nell Menefee-Libey - senior manager of public policy for the national WIC Association.
 - Would waitlist applicants to reduce costs
 - Progressive leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities said that if Congress doesn't meet the 1 billion dollar shortfall, there could be as few as 2 million affected people.

Problem Statement: 
Date, Who did what? What is the consequence of what they did and who is affected. Can you provide a timeline, numbers, and names?

If Congress fails to approve the $1.4 billion in emergency funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) by March, as few as 2 million pregnant and postpartum women along with young children will be waitlisted for the program by September of 2024.

What legislation can be passed to guarantee the the appropriate federal funds from Congress to ensure that WIC will be fully funded for the 2024 fiscal year?
