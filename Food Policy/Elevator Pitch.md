The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is a vital nutritional and educational resource for approximately 7 million financially at-risk pregnant and postpartum persons, infants, and children. 

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated a $6.3 Billion budget for the FY2024 for the programs. Officials have since corrected that price to an additional $1.4 Billion due to the increased prices of foods by 5.8% _(social math_) in 2023 alongside the increased participation in the WIC program. 

Suppose Congress fails to increase the necessary funding required to fulfill the nutritional needs of families in 2024. In that case, roughly a third or as few as 2 million pregnant and postpartum women along with young children will be waitlisted by September 2024 disproportionality impacting families of color. "Now to give you some perspective, last month in PA, 182688 people across all its counties. That is, the potentially 2 waitlisted million people, or about 10 times all the PA participants last month wouldn't have access to proper nutritional foods _(**social math**)_

Problem Statement: What legislation can be passed to guarantee the appropriate federal funds from Congress to ensure that WIC will be fully funded for the 2024 fiscal year?


Solution: Federally ensure the House of Representatives jurisdiction over supplemental funding for WIC and Child Nutrition Authorization mandatorily complies, by state, with the needs of these respective programs. Furthermore, such a policy can be used scientifically by data analysists and food scientist to  guarantee supplemental nutrition to those who apply for WIC. It also would fund necessary informational like resources such as nutritional counciling for families, and support resources around breastfeeding. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 is a qualitative example of such policies that include budgeting funds to allocate and ensure the prosperity of WIC infrastructure and its decennial scientific evaluation.
