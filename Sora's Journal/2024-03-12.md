I'm feeling good today! I know today's gonna be a very engaging, but it's definitely going to be rewarding when I'm all said and done. I've got quite a few things to do, so we'll see how that goes! I think what I'm most excited for is to do some problems for PDE. I think I'm also excited to be preparing for the midterm next week. I'm so proud of myself for actually starting review this early, like I feel comfortable enough with the content in E&M, but I really wanna master it. Maybe master is a little much but you get the idea. I'm gone Ace that test for sure. Well I think we should get started. I'll probably be back, so I'll see you then!
