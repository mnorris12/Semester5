Hola JJ, 

Today we're gonna be doing some PDEs! I'm excited to read chapter 4 and be caught up, but I'm really not excited to understand some of the these solutions because they are extremely long and unnecessary. I don't think I'll spend a ton of time writing them. 

#### How do you feel today?

I think I feel good today! I had a good start to my day and I made sure to take a 5 minute meditation time right before this! I'm relaxed and ready to understand some material! I really want to be on my grind this spring break, so that way next week isn't so difficult. I really need to make sure that my mental health is okay, and maybe getting ahead and studying for the E&M test will help me feel less anxious, although I know I'm going to ace it for sure. I'm also excited, as we'll be holding a get together at my place tonight! This means in order to party, I've got to get some work done! I'm in my room right now, but when my clothes finish drying, I'll head to SCI! See you later today, if you decide to come back and write something!
