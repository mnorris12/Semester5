Hey Holley, 

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the last call that we had, and I’ve been thinking about the best way to approach this, but I was really uncomfortable with you saying racial slurs as a white person. I feel like at this point in my life, I’ve taken a lot of time to understand what it means to be a black queer man, and a minority in general. I’ve come to respect and be more knowledgable about my culture, and white people saying hurtful things like slurs is something I’d end a friendship over now. I’m also confused as to why you thought I may appreciate something of that nature. In the last few years where we lived together in Sylva, I feel like there was various times where I hinted that those things weren’t okay, and although I didn’t have a concrete idea for you why, principally, the notion that slurs or racism weren’t okay in my friendships where there. I really think this is something that deserves it’s own conversation through a call, because I really value or friendship and of course, I still love you like a sister. But I’m not okay with hearing those things against minorities. When you have time, we should definitely talk, as I’d like to see you in November when I come back to NC, but I don’t want to hear those things or feel like I have to sacrifice my worth as a black queer feminine man in order to hang around you all. All the best, Marqualand.
