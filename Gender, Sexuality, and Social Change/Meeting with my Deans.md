Give context about the course 
- Paper ABC, 
- how long have you had to write the paper
- Monday course from 7-10
- I'm trying to come to an understanding while respecting myself

*They have been disrespectful to their WA. For instance, with the second paper assignment, they initially did not submit their assignment, then submitted it late by email, did not sign up for a conference with their WA, cancelled after they did, then cancelled again, and eventually met late with the WA, and then submitted two different versions of the paper to me.* 

- It is true that I did not submit my second draft on time. It was due on March 4th and while I had about 4 to 5 pages prepared I didn't want to waste the time of my WA without a full draft. At this point, I didn't know things would have been smoother to work with the 4-5 pages I already had, and we could go from there.  My WA reached out to me initially on March 5th at 9:39 PM regarding him not having the paper, and to get it to him before the next meeting. I reached back out to him the next day on March 6th 2:20 PM shortly before our WA meeting letting him know that I hadn't finished the draft, and it would better to meet after spring break, but I was still willing to meet. Spring break happened.
- To be clear, the order of things isn't correct. What really happened - I didn't turn in my WA copy because my paper wasn't done (I later found out that was the case for many other students and I should have submitted it anyway), I reached out to both the WA and Professor Atshan about it, and we worked something out starting March 19, and there was a meeting scheduled with my WA on March 26. (talk about how you reached to prof Atshan on Monday the day the paper was due). I submitted the final draft on time on March 18, but Atshan required a WA copy so I was to meet with the WA on March 26, and I handed in, by accident, two final copies and one WA copy. Contrary to what Professor Atshan says, I did originally sign up for my WA appointment on time, and although I couldn't make it,  on March 19 Nick and I extensively coordinated our WA meeting over the next week. I also didn't cancel a second meeting, just once initially on March 6th. The second meeting I was there. Submitting two final papers and one WA copy instead of one final paper and one WA copy was a genuine mistake that he could have easily sent a quick email about. He asked me to choose the correct copy in class when he handed back the papers on April 1st. I choose the correct copy, and I haven't received my graded paper since then.

- I would like to mention that Nick has never expressed being frustrated with me and continued to be very kind and helpful throughout the entire process.

Atshan:  The WA shared with me that they advised Sora to communicate with me and that they need to request accomodations if needed and Sora never followed up.  
 - I don't doubt this information was true although I don't clearly remember being stated. It's very possible that Nick did say something about this. However if you look at the email on Wed, march 6th from Nick, he told me to reach out to Professor Atshan about the paper, and Professor Atshan told me to reach out to him. I assume it was a misunderstanding.

*With the paper due last Monday, the WA and I realized it was missing and emailed Sora to ask about it.* 
- The paper was actually due this Monday, which may be a difference of grammar, but more concretely, it was due on Monday April 15. 
*Sora falsely claimed they submitted it and then acknowledged that they hadn't once we pressed them this morning.
- The second sentence - I stated that I thought I had submitted it, but if the WA didn't have it then I don't know where it is. We were to submit our papers during a guest conference in the Scheuer room where there were many people and I was struggling to find a seat. One faculty member, and elderly professor I assume, was sitting on the floor until a seat was found for her. It may have slipped my mind truly. 
	- Secondly and most importantly, professor Atshan says "we pressed them", meaning him and my WA. What authority does a WA, another student, have to "press" a student about their late work alongside a professor? Next, Nick, not once, responded to the comment thread. The last personal contact I've had by email with Nick was over three weeks ago. This is a conscious lie for which I believe Professor Atshan was not expecting to me to see his email to my dean.
*They just submitted an unacceptable very short draft that does not meet most of the guidelines that I clearly spelled out for the assignment (in person, by email, and on Moodle). *
- Many people haven't finished the third draft and I know individuals who've submitted less than I have, and to my knowledge and theirs, they haven't received any academic repremanding. 

 *I also have concerns from what I see that they are not the primary author of the submission.* 
- This accusation is particular surprising and extremely disheartening, because its false and has no basis. Never before, in the first essay, its draft, the second essay, and its draft, not anywhere in his email yesterday has he ever accused me of Plagiarism or have I done so. My writing was one page introduction followed by a short outline for the rest of the paper. I then put the outlines of each book, which my friends and I coordinated together as to ease the academic load of analyzing three books to use for drafts. To my knowledge, I thought it would be best to present the WA with all the ideas and information so he could best help me in the ways he could. No AI or outside resources were used in the making of any of the content in the document. This claim was quickly thrown in Atshan's accusation without any prior mention to his student, and no further information provided in the email he sent to the deans. Such an accusation can get a student like me expelled from attending Swarthmore, when in reality was a baseless claim that he knows as a professor he can easily use with lack of proper consequences. 
*Furthermore, Sora has been direspectful to me as well with their communication.* 
- Never, in-person or over email have I been rude to professor Atshan. I believe he's talking about this email I sent yesterday, which is the latest email I've sent before he, later that day, reached out to my deans, 

"Hi Professor Atshan, 


Thank you for addressing me properly! I **sincerely apologize** for the paper length, and I truly did what I could with the allotted time. I really hope this case isn't unique considering what I've heard from other students. I would like to mention that thus far this conversation has felt very interrogative which, unfortunately is not a unique experience for me. I would like to state that I do plan on speaking up for myself and do not intend to be complacent with gestures, attitudes, or actions that make me uncomfortable, and so as kindly as possible I'll make that clear if it happens. I hope you can understand where I'm coming from with this statement, no hostility, but just for my own well-being, and protection. I hope we can go about this amiably as I really enjoy being your student and the class till now. I really appreciate your understanding and you're patience with me thus far. Also, this seems like a conversation that no longer should include Nick, and maybe shouldn't have included him in the beginning. Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you again Professor Atshan, 

best regards, 

Sora"
		- Nothing in this email was meant out of spite and I made that clear in my words. He was hostile and refused to properly addressed me with proper email etiquette. Again, many other students submitted incomplete drafts and have received no notification of the consequences. I do not want to be singled out as an example or whatever the case may be. It's easy to do that to a black student. I've after having been racially profiled by police offices, members of the Swarthmore community, students, and professors, and so I will take up for myself. It is for my own protection and safety, but it's honestly a survival tactic. I've had to reach out to the Office of Equal Opprotunity and Engagement to deal with racial profiling by a instructor earlier this semester. As it is, I don't feel comfortable being a black and queer student on this campus. His inclusion of Nick felt more so that he wanted to embarrass me and wanted to include Nick in a conversation that he shouldn't have been in. I'm actively being repremanded by a professor, and a student shouldn't be invited into such a conversation
		- Nevertheless, I have email receipts, that I have never been rude to Professor Atshan. As a matter of fact, I've been very kind and cordial with him. Please feel free to check the emails between us. None have been deleted and there are the living breaving undebatable proof of him lying. He's characterized our relationship as disrespectful furthering an anti-blackness stereotype that wasn't clearly explained.
		- 
*I have named this to them clearly and informed the WA that they no longer have to deal with this case. The WA is fatigued from having to chase after the student.*  
	I'm not for sure if Nick actually thinks, since professor Atshan continues to speak from him, and he's said literally nothing so far. I wonder if Nick actually knows how much is happening and if he knew, what would he say? He's been extremely kind to me and understanding of the situation of other students as well.

*Throughout the semester, I have repeatedly asked Sora to meet with me and they never followed up. I have no idea what is going on in this case.*  
- Professor Atshan has never personally reached out to me by email regarding extending circumstances that affect my ability in class. He once asked me if I'm just a STEM student once in class with notion there may have been some struggle in the class on my part, to which I responded that a lot of transformation is going on in my life. He at least knew this. I also have already scheduled office hours with Professor Atshan before this situation happened. All of his office hours were a schedule conflict (throughout the semester), and I managed to find a time next week. Again, another conscious lie. I'm currently undergoing the process of getting a therapist through Caps, both off campus, and, through an additional program, and I'm in the process of getting psychiatric help. I've also been having bi-weekly conversations with the department chair of physics, as my major has been extremely polarizing and difficult for me.

Multiple reasons for concern


-  Professor Atshan continues to misgender throughout this message. I'm not for sure what kind of access he has regarding this information, but I imagine as a Professor he might. If not, I've done in class introductions announcing my pronouns, and he literally made us make a powerpoint the first or second day of class with our name, picture, and prefered pronouns. It is not hard to address someone properly and professor Atshan has made it clear that he can't do that. 


Lastly Professor Atshan sends an email to the entire class including the all the WAs where I believe he references my actions. He uses similar language in that email as he's used against me which gives me reason to believe he was targeting me. That along with the timing of the email being the same day the situation went down. Notice how two times have turned to three, when it was only once to begin with! My meeting with my WA is still scheduled and my paper was definitely going to get to them before later next week. 

I cannot explain how tired I am of this. I've been extremely anxious and I'm literally giving out. 


#### Going forward
- should I reach out to Nick
- Should I attend my already scheduled office hours with him
