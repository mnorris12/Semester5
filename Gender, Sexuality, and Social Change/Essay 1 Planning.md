How do the documents show change over time? What similarities and differences do you notice between the time(s) when these documents were written, and the current moment? Write a conclusion paragraph. 



What are the interesting things you've noticed in the Seneca Falls document?
- Dealing with the subjugation of women Socially, civil, and religiously
- For the very first day of the convention,  July 19th, 1848, only "women who are earnestly invited" would attend. This suggest some of hierarchy or elitism that divided women, even though they urgently needed to unify.
- Immediately, the Declaration of Sentiments begins similarly to the US's Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal"
- The very first page is nearly indiscernible to the DOI, until it get's specific near the very end. It starts to talk about the sufferance of women under the US government. 
- The feminism in this document seeks to discuss the tyranny of a man on a women
- On the second page, they bring up women's suffrage, or the right to vote. They also mention that, legally, marriage for a women makes her "civilly dead". Very impactful words. 
- The second page begins every paragraph with "He" further highlighting the perpetrator of women's sufferance. It also details women's rights of business ownership, children custody, education, and place in church
- It's also interesting how, contradictory on the last page, nearly every paragraph begins with He, addressing singularly the culmination of a man by his actions, yet on the next page, the women together express themselves as "we", adding utilizing the power of numbers
- A lot of rights have to do with the religious context of this time. The conference was shortly after the end of the Second Great Awakening. 
- Also, a lot of the demands and the writing in general seeks equality between men and women. Not just the distinction that women should be able to do everything a man can do, but also, if society expects women to do certain things and hold themselves to a certain stature, men should be expected to do the same.  
- The document exclaims that oppression against women is universal. That,"Form the man of highest mental cultivation to the most degraded wretch who staggers in the streets do we meet ridicule"


What are the interesting things you've noticed among the photographs of the National Women's Conference in Houston 1977? 
- The very first picture where the room is separated by states, we see a middle aged women on the left, who has a hat that says "Pro God Pro Family", similar to the topics mentioned in the DOS
- The legality of abortion is fought for in the third image which shows women with signs of a slashed clothe's hanger. It represents the rights to women's bodies. What may be interesting to point out is the inclusion of people of color. It could potentially be the case that the intersectionality between race and feminism hasn't quite been discovered.
- The women in fourth photo are deep in thought. The attire of these women are characterized by wealth or a sustained well-being. This would suggest, similar to the Seneca Falls Woman's Rights Convention that there is an accessibility aspect to feminism
- The fifth photo is quite interesting as a women is proudly holding up a sign that says "We are all Lesbians"
- The next photo shows a black women speaking into a microphone, reading a paper script. 
	- One of the interesting things about the 1977 conference is the emerging method of expressing their thoughts/opinions. These come in the forms of buttons, pins, signs/posters, that are straight to the point, and immediately grabs the attention of who's reading them. 
- The last photo show a black women with many different pens coat. One includes "Viva la Mujer!" which suggest the emergence of feminism and the rights of Spanish-speaking women, and how it's crossed the boundary of English. 


Were there any similar details between the excerpt and the pictures?
- passion in their work in feminism. We see, for the first time, the collection of fervent zeal in their fight for feminism. Such zeal or passion had been nurtured by the 68 women who signed the DOS, and 129 years, that passion continued to inspire the many outspoken women in Houston, Texas. 
- the utilization of "power in number" which is a benefit of holding a convention of mostly

Were there any differing details between the excerpt and the pictures?
- The representation in the fight for the equality of women was changed beginning its course at Seneca Falls until the current day. Only "women who are earnestly invited" would attend. This suggest some of hierarchy or elitism that divided women, even though they urgently needed to unify. In the 1977 National Women's Conference every ideology, religious preference, racial and ethnic group, income background, and age were represented. 
- Investigating the material differences between the two conferences in the current day, the usage of buttons becomes a matter of discussion. Buttons have been used since the mid-20th century as a popular method of showing support for specific causes during demonstrations and protests.  

Transition over time: 
- The Seneca Falls Convention was like a seedling addressing core social, civil, and religious rights of women that would allow them to become an equal citizen. In its nature, it's very similar to the the statements in the Declaration of Independence not only in it's literature, but how those very declarations would continue to fight for specific subgroups of the population of women. This becomes evident when, in the National Women's Conference in Houston, the women in attendance make no mistake to honor the work of feminists of the 19th century. To that note, Gloria Scott, the then National President of Girl Scouts, used a gavel, originally belong to Susan B Anthony, when giving a speech as a key note speaker at the conference. Such zeal had been nurtured by the women who signed the Declaration of Sentiments 129 years prior to the conference in Houston. Nevertheless, the Seneca Falls Convention and the current state of feminism have their the similarities and differences.
