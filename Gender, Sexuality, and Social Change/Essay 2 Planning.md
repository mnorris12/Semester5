#### How do you define social change and Feminist Ethnography?

Social change is broadly defined as the transformation of cultural, economic, political and social institutions and relationships over time.

The feminist ethnography, only coined in the late 20 century, is an umbrella term with many many meanings haven been forged from past to present. It includes the cultural and social development of feminism throughout the world and continues to include and vocalize gender minorities as social dynamics become more inclusive. The feminist ethnography serves many purposes including highlighting the variety of accounts of patriarchy's detriment, it serves as a space where women and gender minorities can enrich their understanding of themselves through the recorded accounts of others, and it also attempts to build solutions to the modern day problems (although steming from the past) caused by the patriarchy. Much of history is told through the prospective of a man, or simply irrespective of the women who endured, who are also disproportionately affected. 

Social change incorporates how time can transform the humane aspects of life. That is, it can alter the cultural, political, and social structures that humans have continously built. Regardless of to which pole social change favors at any instance, good or bad, it must affect every group of people who are in some way related. More specifically, every individual in that group will exhibit personality traits based on the way social change has integrated themselves in their culture. It will shape the way an individual, and especially a child, thinks, reacts, talks, etc. In the context of the lives of the books, social change acts as patriarchal tool in which new was of subjugating the female body emerge. These changes come about in the form of gender roles where women are expected to do certain responsibilities and met standards that revolve on the males desired life experience. But sociayou l change is more than just its effects, its also can be defined as its consequences that lead women to speak their mind. Such consequences are protests and activist work to build autonomy and fight for rights among women. So in various ways, social change has the power to bring people together or divide them.

Ethnography is a flexible, responsive, and iterative form of research and is **well suited to answering many of the kinds of questions feminists are interested in**. Ethnography, in general, is a form of research that asks questions about the social and cultural practices of groups of people.

- Analyzing the colonial impact on women which affected the reconstruction of these societies after a period of violence
	- Veena Das particularly talks a lot about this! Look particularly on page 36 and 113
	- It's talked about in the Vietnam book! How the wealth gained by sex workers allowed for them to gain status in society as. They were also able to send remittances home and help their families. Chapter 7 talks about this
	- Peru - The third chapter (Being Human Talks about this) in the Sasachakuy Tiempo. The reconstructing of a society that has undergone such violence involves reconstructing the mindsets of the individuals in that society.
	- You could also talk about how each of the authors do this individually!
- The construction of the silence culture by women during and after a violent period. To elaborate, other women become silent in the event that another woman is abused or sufers during the violent period in order to avoid the same fate themselves. 
	- We see this in the Peru book (Speaking of silences) with the mute girl
	- You could potentially find something for Veena Das (Three portraits of Grief and Mourning)
	- Chapter 6 that talks about the surgical process many women went through for Asian Ascendancy could have some useful information in it!
- The role of political power's subjugation of women
	- You can probably find something interesting for the Peru book in chapters Ayacucho is the Grade, or Fluid Fundamentalists
	- As for the Veena Das book there should be a lot of content that touches on the state's role in the subjugation of women. More specifically you can look at chapter 2 the figure of the abducted women to find some good information. You could also check page 22
	- For the Asian Ascendancy book I recommend taking a look at chapter 3. 


#### What quotes will you use? 

 Analyzing the colonial impact on women which affected the reconstruction of these societies after a period of violence
 - Dealing in Desire (79)
	 - Workers in Secrets and Naughty Girls, who catered to Western businessmen and Western tourists, helped clients engage in philanthropy-oriented intimacy built around developing intimate relations with clients critical to attracting overseas money framed as charity projects through benevolent remittances. Thus, while Khong Sao Bar was important for helping to attract FDI into the country, the three bars that catered to overseas Viet Kieus, Western businessmen, and Western tourists were tied to different logics attached to remittances.
 - Intimate Enemies
	 - 
 - Violence and the Descent into the ordinary (113)
	 - I need only briefly note here that in the Hindu imagery of the nation, the homeland was a motherland, and though the nation was conceived as masculine, it was made up of the sons of a mother. The imagery in the nationalist discourse during the struggle against British colonialism represented the nation as a mother who was shackled by foreign rule and laid claims on her valiant sons to rescue her.
~~The construction of the silence culture by women during and after a violent period.~~
- Dealing in Desire
	- As Tony described it, flirting allowed women to embody nation as home for a group of diasporic men looking to feel rooted in the motherland. Women’s performances of femininity played into men’s nostalgic sense of an old Vietnam, allowing men to hold on to vestiges of the past and import them into Vietnam’s modernizing present.
 - Intimate Enemies (103)
	 - They stood in line to rape her, taking advantage of her inability to verbally express her pain. Her female neighbors told us, with a mixture of compassion and shame, that “We couldn’t do anything. We were afraid they would visit us as well.” So they listened to her at night, along with her grandmother who sat across the room, unable to protect her granddaughter.
 - Violence and the Descent into the ordinary (29)
	 - Paradoxically the authority of the woman social worker was used to silence the voice of the woman as subject and to put upon her an obligation to remember that the abductor to whom she was now married was the murderer of her husband or her father.
The role of political power's subjugation of women
 - Dealing in Desire
 - Intimate Enemies
 - Violence and the Descent into the ordinary



#### Notes
My personal questions:
- What is the intersectionality between all three of books? Can you list chapters for each of the books that overlap with other chapters in the books? These will be the chapters that we'll actually read!

- 1-2 sentence summary for each of the chapters in the book!
	- *Violence and Reconciliation in Peru*
		- Part 1. The difficult Time
			- 3.  **Ayacucho is the Crade** Armed conflict occured in protest to politics in Peru. The Communist party rose and violently burned ballot boxes. Known in Quechua as the Sasaschakuy Tiempo. 
			- 24. **Sensuous Psychologies** This chapter talks about listening to the testimonies of the people in Peru. She talks about relatores which are the individuals who translated the testimonies from Quechua into Spanish, and the relatos were the stories themselves. 
			- 54. **Being Human** The work in order to fix the social dynamic in a region/country troubled by such violence involves reconstructing the minds of the humans in that society. The experience of the Sasachakuy Tiempo was described as dehumanizing according to the people. 
				- "We lived and died like dogs" and "we had to leave our dead loved ones wherever they were"
			- 67.  **Fluid Fundamentalisms** For the beginning of the chapter, she basically gives a personal account of her trip to Huanta at 9:00 AM. She was in search of the evangelical pastor, Pastor Vidal. More specifically the communist regime in Peru at this time were killing off the religious entities
		- Part 2: Common sense, Gender, and war
			- 103. **Speaking of silences** Opens with an anecdote of Eulogia, a mute girl who'd be sexually assaulted by soldiers. The other women who knew what was happening were to scared to say anything in fear of what might happen to them.  The author continues to talk about how people talk about rape. 
			- 143. **The Widows** The productive consequences of the armed conflict finally started to emerge, and in general they tend to emerge after much time has passed after the conflict.
		- Part 3" Looking North
			- 185. **Intimate Enemies** This part seeks to answer the question of "how did individuals becomes so killable?". This part seeks to answer this question and pose a few more. " What are the resources individuals and collectives use to bring the killing to a halt? And, cone the killing stops, what happens next?"
			- 225. **The Micropolitics of Reconciliation** The affect of the language barrier between those who spoke Quechua and those who spoke Spanish. This limited some of the resources of those who couldn't speak Spanish. 
			- 252. **Deliverance** The violence suffered and the violence inflicted both require some reconciliation. This is especially true in the case of women and men, where a lot of the women endured the suffering and a lot of the men committed the suffering. 
			- 277. **Legacies: bad Luck, Angry Gods, and the stranger** The author presents this dichotomy of living in communities steeped in civil conflict, where the memories of the civilians are traumatizing and but it leaves hope for the future. 
		- Part 4 Looking South

		- 1. **The Event and the Everyday**
			- Basically describing the partition of 1947
		- 18. **The Figure of the Abducted Woman: The Citizen as Sexed**
			- The burden of this chapter is to try to understand how public anxieties around sexuality and purity might have created the ground on which the figure of the violated woman became an important mobilizing point for reinstating the nation as a "pure" and masculine space
			- Building masculinity in society setting a proper and better standard for women
			- Goes for Hindus, Muslims, Sihks
		- 38. **Language and Body: Transaction in the Construction of Pain**
			- Essentially the objectification of women's bodies for the purpose of nationalism

		- 79. **Boundaries, Violence, and the Work of Time**
			- The struggle of authors and field workers of losing the ability to truly comprehend the violence that happens. 
			- How can human beings be capable of such things. 
		- 95. **Thinking of Time and Subjectivity**
			- Subjectivity and objectivity
			- People think of the partition as something that's in the past
				- people who have trauma don't view time as linear, but cyclical
			- People consider concepts like sex education to be post-modern or post-colonial discourse
				- However these ideas have existed pre-colonialism
		- 108: **In the Region of Rumor**

			  "womanly" or feminine, the idea that violence and masculinity are synonymous
			  The view of India as a feminine society.
		- 135. **The Force of the Local**
			- The nature and impact of daily life
			- Events are singular, both in life and in private
		- 162. **The Signature of the State: The Paradox of Illegibility**
			- I want to argue, instead, that if we see how authority of the state is literalized and embodied in the contexts of violence in the Sultanpuri low-income neighborhoods I describe, we come to see the state as neither a purely rational-bureaucratic organization nor simply a fetish, but as a form of regulation that oscillates between a rational mood e and a magical mode of being. 
			- First, magic has consequences that are real - hence I prefer to speak of the magic of the state rather that the fictions of the state. Second, the forces that are mobilized for performance of magic are not transparent. Third, magical practices are closely aligned to forces of danger because of the combination of obscurity and power. Finally, to engage in magic is to place oneself in a position of vulnerability. 
		- 184. **Three Portraits of Grief and Mourning**
			- The death of Shanti Devi's husband and children $\rightarrow$ women's role as a mother and wife, she felt like she lost her purpose in life
				- Grieved her family and her purpose
				- Women's role in societies $\rightarrow$ seen as extension of men, their purpose is tied to a man's position
			- Men should be men, no one should get in the way of their place/position in society 
			- Duality of the woman trying to find her purpose and her authority
		- 205. **Revisiting Trauma, Testimony, and Political Community**
			- The politics of language, framing of violence
				- communal violence, state-sponsored violence
			- The role of anthrolopology in the telling of important stories
				- Missing the day-to-day lives of people who live through history
	- *Dealing in Desire: Asian ascendancy, eastern decline, and the hidden currencies of global sex work.*
