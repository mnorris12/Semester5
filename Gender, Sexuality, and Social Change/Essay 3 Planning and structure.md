##### Analysis 1 - The Phenomenon of the Double Minority: Occupation and Queerness  (Land-locked)

Progress:
- Draft - In progress
- Revision - Not started

Main Argument: Each of the quote I've offered below provide a personal account of those who are affected by the phenomenon of being a double minority. At its heart, these ethnographies express that queer people in an occupied region, even chronologically, disproportionately experience the effects of occupation and their resulting gruesome subjectivities. 

Ideas:
- I’d like to express here the coupling of occupied people, and queerness. I'm not entirely sure what this looks like so I'm gonna quickly get some motivation to see what I'm writing about. Here's some things that I've gathered from the internet
	- Queer Liberation can never be had without the end of military occupation and global militarism. Why might this be? Well, I'm thinking that occupation requires militarism, that is, there's a country or some kind of authority power that's using a military in order to gain power/resources/or achieve goals. Militarism in itself, is homophobic. 
		- The separation of liberation and the battle of queer rights is especially prominent as a topic in activism. For a long time, it was believed that liberation/deoccupation/divestment are all of first priority, while queer rights was to wait patiently for its battle to commence. However, they are intertwined because homophobia is a part of occupation and exists in the form of pinkwashing/pinkwathcing, unauthorized access to photos (in the case of Envisioning African Intersex), segregation of punishment in the case of the Holocaust, etc. So the question becomes, how does one who seeks to advocate for change, fight for deoccupation and queer rights simultaneously? This is what we'll leave for the book quotes

Quotes:
- Possible chapters I could use from Queer Palestine: 
	- Chapter 2
		- pg 67 - "Rayan told me that he said to Hosni. "I wish we could do this openly in Ramallah. One day I hope we will. But Tel Aviv is also part of our homeland. No matter what anyone, says, this will always be Palestine to us. " It is a travesty that a queer Palestinian couple must go through such a struggle just for the ordinary act of seeing a part of the ancestrial homeland, but their material pragmatism reflected the spirit of queer Palestinian resistance and resilience."
- Possible chapters I could use from Envisioning Intersex in South Africa: 
	- Chapter 3 
		- Pg. 80 - "She also details the international ramifications, I believe that John Money's misleading reports about the outcome of the John/Joan case, which became standard text-book fodder, provided a model for the interventions in these muti-muliation-related surgeries. Since John Money used the John/Joan case and its alleged outcome to provide "empirical" support for this theories about the treatment of intersexed infants and children, the issue of surgery on babies and children who were victims of muti-related mutilation is related to the treatment of intersexed infants and children."  
	- Chapter 4 - N/A
- Possible chapters I could use from The Pink Triangle:
	- Chapter nfs
		- pg. 166 "Thus, when gay inmates tried to join a clandestine camp committee, they were rejected. Both Nazi overseers and their prisoners took it for granted that the men with the pink triangles were somehow biologically programmed to seek nothing but sexual satisfaction. Homophobia flourished everywhere, making it nearly impossible for gays to join any effort by prisoners to improve conditions in the barracks. They were suspect as a class. Whatever assistance they might offer was though to mask a sexual motive. "
	- Chapter nfs
		- pg. 173 "It happened in June 1942.... After roll call... an order was suddenly given: "All inmates with pink triangles will remain standing at attention" Our Kapo barked:"Three hundred criminal deviants present as ordered.". We learned that we were to be segregated in a penal command and the next morning would be transferred as a unit to the cement works... We shuddered because these bone mills were more dreaded than any other work detail."

Analysis Structure: 
- Introduction - Here you'll want to introduce your first analysis point in detail. Define what you're you'll be discussing at length.
- Argument - Now that you've defined what your argument is, you'll want to explain how queer ethnographies represent this, and what social change comes about. 
- Evidence - Here you'll want to state your evidence
	- In chronological order, you'll analyze The Pink Triangle, Envisioning Intersex in South Africa, and Queer Palestine and the Empire of Critique.
	- Provide short summary
	- Transition into quote
	- Discuss quote and social change
- Short conclusion. Can be a microparagraph that highlights your claim, and very importantly, connects to social change. 


##### Analysis 2 - The Phenomenon Continued: The Effect of Media beyond the boarders 

Progress:
- Draft -  In progress
- Revision  - Not started

Main argument:

Ideas: 
- I think a good transition is really important from the first to the second analysis! I think in general, it's important to have two different analysis that are well grounded and are on different subjects, but still have connections to each other. 
- I like the idea of discussing the infiltration of colonialist morals, ideals, and ways of life into these minority societies, and what effects come about as a result. 
- I think one of the issues I might be having here is how I could delineate the first and second analysis. It might be smarter to have two different focal points for the same topics, rather than a broad analysis and a more in depth version. 
- Maybe Queerness in Media? The effects of western media on queerness in these regions, rather than also occupation

---
 Analysis 2 - In the first analysis, the double minority of being queer in an occupied region was discussed in the context of that region. Now, with such dynamics discussed and established, it's necessary to understand how outside entities, especially North American and European ones, affect queer individuals in these oppressed lands. This analysis will expand beyond occupation and rather discuss how western involvement impacts queer dynamics in Palestine, South Africa, and Taiwan. 


- Possible chapters I could use from Queer Palestine: 
	- pg. 147 "Another case that became salient in the Western press was that of Taleen Abu Hanna, a trans Palestinian Christian woman from Nazareth. In May 2016, Abu Hanna, a citizen of Israel, won the Miss Trans Israel competition, the country's first transgender beauty pageant. Time magazine quoted her as saying, in "perfect Hebrew, . . . I wouldn't be alive if I grew up in Palestine. . . .  Not as a gay man, and definitely not as a transgender woman." She added, "I got really lucky to live in a country where they bring everything to you on a silver platter," and, at the same time, "there is still room for improvement, and still some rights we deserve.""
- Possible chapters I could use from Envisioning Intersex in South Africa: 
	- pg. 104 "The late South African feminist scholar Elaine Salo explains, "The media reports of these responses were juxtaposed with visual images of Caster Semenya's muscular body and... her blackness and her dominance over her more experiences European counterparts that seemed to be so antithetical to acceptable femenity""
- Possible chapters I could use from Family Change in Taiwan: 
	- pg. 7 "For example, antigay protestors in Taiwan appropriated the slogan “one man + one woman” from the U.S. antigay movement. This symbol was originally intended to represent a “traditional” family but in the context of Taiwan represents, instead, another kind of “modern” family departing from the intergenerational, ancestral, and extended family bonds that have been central to Taiwanese family structure and organization."
	- pg. 87 "They saw these figures as antidotes to sensationalized stories about gay male hypersexuality, lesbian murder-suicides, and deeply possessive, even violent, relationships between women propagated by local media. For instance, in March 2012, reporters broke a story about a T who killed her ex-girlfriend’s new (cisgender) boyfriend and found a so-called expert to go on record saying that T’s are jealous of men and deeply possessive of their women; thus, men who date former pos should be careful."

##### Conclusion

Ideas:
- You know what I'm gonna say. Idealistically, you need to add a new perspective that you haven't already in your conclusion.
- You wanna rap up some of the things you've already said throughout the story
- I would start by redefining social just and queer ethnographies. Kinda just rephrase what you said in the introduction
- Break to a second paragraph that covers your first analysis. 
- Break to a third paragraph that covers you second analysis.

##### Cool words I found to make you sound smart lol

tendentiously - in a way that expresses or supports a particular opinion that many people disagree with.
egregious - extraodinary in some bad way
Disenfranchise - deprive someone of a right


without analyzing the pinkwashing undertone of Abu Hanna's account, the dehumanization of the Palestinian society is internalized in the west and its negative effects on the country go unnoticed. She implies that she'd be dead if she lived in Palestine which suggests that there's no substance at all to bridge the gap between queer Palestinians and their heterosexual counterpart in Palestine. Effectively, if there's nothing to bridge that gap, then queer Palestinians are defaultly always dehumanized in Palestine. Accounts like these take away from the need of a simultaneous struggle for queer rights and deoccupation, and solutionizes it to excluding Palestine entirely. Atshan's inclusion of Trans-Palestinian experiences similar to Abu Hanna's illustrate that, in fact, Palestine isn't as monolithic in attitude towards queer people which is adjacent to the experience of Hosni and Rayan.
