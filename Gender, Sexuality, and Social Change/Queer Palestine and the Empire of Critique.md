#### Introduction 

###### Definitions: 
- Radical Purists - Essentially hypercritical scholars who want competition over moral purity, debates on representation, limits on institutional capacities, rigid policies on international aid, criticism of those to whom they are closest, and other factors have led to the fragmentation of the Queer Palestinian movement.
- Pinkwashing (pg.3) - defined as a3
- Pinkwatching (pg.5) - term to describe the process of deconstructing and debunking pinkwashing. 
- Ethnoheteronormativity (pg.11) - The structure of ethnogeteronormativity attempts to recast queer Palestinian political subjectivity in terms of patriarchal and state logics. This makes spaces for radical hybridity invisible; if queer Palestinians combine critiques of homophobia and Zionism, their critiques becomes invisible because the terms they are using (gay and lesbian) to critique homophobia are seen as by-products of Israel and West's colonial agenda. 
- Natural plateaus (pg.20) - "Natural plateaus are the result of the movement having reached its natural marketshare in terms of audience and capacity, having caught the attention of most of those who would be interested in its work"
- Toxi Plateaus (pg.20) - "Toxic plateaus are those in which the normal forward motion of a movement is cut off, which occurs when activists find themselves besieged on all sides so that they no longer know to whom they are accountable or how to construct a progressive agenda."

**Ethnography and Social Movements**
- (pg.29) Collective action among queer Palestinians often stems from submerged participation in everyday life experiences.

**Heterogeneity of Queer Palestinians**

- This section touches upon the challenges queer expression and to what limits it can be unlocked given societal suppression.

The must determine to what extent and how robustly they will name and resist the very violence that many queer Palestinians face from the society and families if their sexuality sexuality is discovered"

**The LGBTQ Movement in Palestine**
- Because of the Queer Palestinian Movement, many organizations and queer peoples have come together to make spaces for each other, including the Aswat and LBTQI

**Queer Palestinian Epistemologies**

- The ways in which queer Palestine think in society and their differing notions of western culture including a different meaning of being in the "closet". Moreover, queer expressions and visibility looks a lot different from western culture as well.

She was not aware that her father was looking through the window. The father declared that Salma had two choices: either marry a man or be killed by her family." 
- (pg.51) "When Al-Qaws activists sprayed graffiti in the West Bank of two men kissing in one spot and two women kissing in another spot, with the captions "Queers passed by here", they were addressing fellow queer Palestinians to let them know they are not alone. The activists were also addressing heterosexual Palestinians who expect queer Palestinians to remain completely invisible."
- (pg. 62) " Another Individual, a trans woman was threatened in public in the West Bank for being overly feminine and was severely  assaulted by a group of men" - she applied for asylum in Europe with the help of Al-Qaws

#### Chapter 2: Global Solidarity and the Politics of Pinkwashing

A brief summary of the whole chapter is offered at the end of page 72, the last paragraph. Atshan also explains the four pillars of Pink Washing the paragraph before. 
 
###### Definitions: 
- PLO- Palestinian Liberation Organization


###### Chapter Section Summaries: 

**Victims and Saviors**
- (pg. 73) "Pinkwashing logic is deployed by individuals and organization using the tropes of victim and savior."
- (pg. 74) " According to Pinkwahsing logic, the queer political landscape can be seen as including only victim and/or benevolent Israelis & Palestinians, straight and queer. In this world view, Israelis, both straight and queer, are victims of Palestinians, while queers, both Israeli and Palestinian, are saved by Zionism."

**Examples of Pinkwashing**
- Yasser Arafat, Chairmain of PLO - media circulated rumors of him being gay. Many articles including one by Kirchick saved the homophobia exuded by Israeli critics (the ones who started the rumors in the first place), and instead, drew attention to Palestinians supposed "denial and obliviousness"
- LGBTQ Birthright Israel trips are another example of Pinkwashing. (pg. 76) "Each year, the program takes thousands of Jewish North American youth on all-expenses paid- trips to Israel, with the aim of deepening the relationship between Israel and the participants."

There are more examples in this section if you'd think you would benefit from this discussion. 

**Homophobia in Israeli Society**
- The acknowledgment of queer Israel falls short both in a global context and that of the Palestine queer movement. Pinkwashing, in this way, affects queer Israel as its seemingly productive attitude denies the vocality of its own queer people. 

**LGBTQ Rights in Israel**
- Many Israeli activists argue that the vocality against Pinkwashing by Palestinians undermine the advancements of the gay Israeli community.

**"Singling out Israel"**
- (pg.95) "Critics of pinkwashing activists claim that such activists are just searching for anything to muddy the name of Israel into an exceptional victim of unwarranted critique that is beyond the critique other nations recieve."

**Queer Palestinians in Israel**
- It's necessary to acknowledge Palestinian homophobia and to name and contextualize the Palestinians who choose to live in Israel. Many times Queer Israel and Palestine are represented as a single entity which doesn't do justice, as they are key differences between the two (one is under military occupation) which undermines the individual oppression that they both face. 

**The Occupation**
- The biggest divide between the queer Palestinian movement and the queer Israeli movement is where the military occupation of Palestine must fit in the context of both. 

**Saving Brown Homosexuals**
- Atshan argues, "To help minimize the entrenchment of homophobia in Palestinian society, activitst can simultaneously engage in naming homophobia, correcting stereotypes about LGBTQ people, challenging pinkwashing, openly identifying themselves as queer and their movemnt as a queer struggle, and introducing more positive representations of queer subjectivities into the public sphere."
###### Quotes: 
(pg. 84) "A 2014 Report indicated that only 13 percent of gay teens (in Israel) felt comfortable talking about the subject of sexual identity with their teachers. Also, 65 percent said they suffered homophobic comments in the hallways, with 17 percent saying their teachers did nothing about it."
