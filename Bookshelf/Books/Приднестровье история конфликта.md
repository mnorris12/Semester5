Description: 
"The book tells about the historical background to the conflict in Transnistria, starting from the Middle Ages - from the Mongol-Tatar and then Hungarian rule, the establishment of an independent principality on the territory of Moldova and its prosperity under Stefan the Great. The history of the region's incorporation into the Russian Empire, its annexation by Romania in 1918-1939 and 1941-1944, and the flourishing of the region's economy and culture during the Soviet period are described in detail. The conflict between Moldovan and Transnistrian authorities, which began in 1989, led to an armed confrontation in 1992, with numerous casualties on both sides. The conflict was terminated thanks to Russian intervention and, in particular, thanks to the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of Transnistria with a peacekeeping mission. The author analyzes the current state of the conflict and reflects on the possibilities of various options for its settlement.
For a wide range of readers."
