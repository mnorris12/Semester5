#### Motivation

In both natural and social sciences, it’s important to understand the dynamics of a system, or how a system works. We understand this by thinking about how a system ages in both time and space.

Practically, in those sciences, to understand such systems, it’s important to find a **connection** between the function and it’s rate of change, rather than finding the function itself that can describe the system. We call this relation, a **differential equation**. This is why they are so important and show up everywhere. 

**Definition**: A differential equation an equality relating a function (typically unknown) and one or more of its derivatives. 
💡 This makes sense! When we see a differential equation, it usually has the original function, along with one or more terms that usually are n-order derivatives.

Ex:

Take a population with size $p$, that grows at a rate proportional to its size at some time $t$. We can create a relationship, or a differential equation used to model that situation: 
$$
\begin{gather}
p’ = r(p) \hspace{.5cm} \text{or} \hspace{.5cm} \frac{dp}{dt} = r(p)
\end{gather}
$$
where we deem, $p$ to be the independent variable, and $t$ to be the independent variable.
❓Is it generally the case that the changed in the numerator is the dependent variable, and the one on the bottom is the dependent variable?

---

Differential equation are very ubiquitous, and arise in math models used in many different areas of study. Some examples are, 
- In both physics and chemistry, they describe fundamental laws. A physics example is $I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$ or the current is the rate of change of the charge over time. 
- They are also used in biology and economics to describe models and make predictions. 


To gain a further understanding of what a differential equation is, we can compare it to equalities we’ve saw in algebra. In algebra, we find need to find a *number* that solves some **static** problem. For example,
$$
\begin{gather}
x+10 = 31 \\ 
x = 21
\end{gather}
$$
💡 I think to be more specific here, by static, we mean that there’s only ever one value we’re looking for. 

In differential equations, we want to find a *function* that solves a **dynamic** problem. For example, 
$$
\begin{gather}
y = dx\\ 
y = e^{ x }, 0
\end{gather}
$$
💡Maybe dynamic refers to a function specifically. 

Some goals that we have we for tackling DEs are, 
1. Determine a solution to the DE
2. Understand what the differential equation is actually doing and how it behaves. Differential equations seem like a mix of numbers, letters, and symbols, but we remember that they describe very important models and fundamental processes, so we need need to think a bit broader to determine what that might be. 
3. Once we’ve understood the differential equation, we interpret the solution as well, for the same reason, and we take time to understand how it fits as a real world tool. 

Now, we want to classify what the ordinary differential equations, and understand its mathematical literature. 

Independent Variables: 
1. An Ordinary differential equation describes the relationship between a function and it’s derivatives where the derivative has a *single* independent variable. Here’s an example,
$$
\begin{gather}
y = 2\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)+6
\end{gather}
$$
💡 As we’ve said earlier, the independent variables are on the bottom, and in this differential equation, there’s only $x$. $y$, the dependent variable, isn’t changing with respect to any other variable. 
2. A partial differential equation describes the relationship between a function and it’s derivatives where the derivative has *multiple* independent variables. Here’s an example, (the wave equation:)
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{u_{tt}}{c^{2}} = u_{x x}
\end{gather} 
$$
💡Similarly, this differential equation, includes some unknown function $u$ that has derivatives with respect to two independent variables, $x,t$. 

Number of Equations: 

1. single equation - here’s an example
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \sin(x) - y
\end{gather}
$$💡 - here, we only have one equation that expresses the relationship between the original function and the derivative. 
2. multiple equations or a system of equations. Here’s an example: 
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{dy_{1}}{dx} = y_{1}-(y_{1}y_{2}) \\ 
\frac{dy_{2}}{dx} = y_{2} +5y_{1}y_{2}
\end{gather}
$$
💡 - Notice here that in both the equations, the original functions are the unknown dependent variables. Also notice that it makes sense that both the functions only include $y_{1},y_{2}$ rather than a different subscript, because they are the only two unknown functions. 

Highest Derivative: 

We use the term **order** when describing differential equations. The order of a differential equation is dictated by the term that’s been derivitated the most. So for example, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{dy}{dx} = y \hspace{.5cm} \text{order 1} \\ \\
\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = \cos x+y \hspace{.5cm} \text{order 2} \\ \\ 
\frac{d^ny}{dx^n} = 2\tan(x) +y’ +y \hspace{.5cm} \text{order n}
\end{gather}
$$
Power of the dependent variable and is derivatives:

We use the terms **linear** and **non-linear** differential equations as well. When we discuss linear equations, they have to be in the form of 
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{d^ny}{dx^n} +p(x)y = f(x)
\end{gather}
$$
where both $p,f$ are also allowed to be constants. If either the derivative, or the original function (so essentially the dependent variable) is raised to some higher power, it’s not linear. Also, if you multiply a derivative of order n by the dependent variable, it is not linear. 
❓ - I believe there’s a separate set of rules that also must be followed, but that could also apply to homogeneity. I don’t remember so we don’t have to get into that right now. 

Here’s some examples: 
$$
\begin{gather}
\text{linear} \rightarrow \hspace{.5cm} 2y’ +y = 3x \hspace{.5cm} y’’ +xy = 4 \\ \\ 
\text{nonlinear} \rightarrow \hspace{.5cm}y’ = \sin(y) \hspace{.5cm}y’’ = y^{2}
\end{gather}
$$

What do solutions to a DE look like? Well, the solution to the differential equation is what ever the original function is. That is, we can plug that original function into both sides of the DE, and they’ll match each other over some specified interval of the independent variable. Here’s an simple example: 
$$
\begin{gather}
y’ = x \\ \\ 
\frac{dy}{dx} = x \rightarrow dy = dx(x) \rightarrow\int dy  = \int x \, dx \\ \\ 
y = \frac{x^{2}}{2} + c
\end{gather}
$$
where $c$ is some arbitrary constant. We now plug our solution to check.  
$$
\begin{gather}
y' = \frac{2(x)}{2} +0  = x
\end{gather}
$$
So we’re correct! This is the direct integration approach. Here’s another example
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{dy}{dx} = -ky \\ \\ 
y = e^{ -kx }
\end{gather}
$$
where $k$ is some positive **parameter** and the differential equation is the exponential decay equation. Interpreting the solution, we can see that as our independent variable $x$ increases, our dependent variables tends to zero. Therefore, our derivative is always proportional to $y$.

The formulation of a ODE and it’s solution: 

A general ODE looks something like: 
$$
\begin{gather}
f(x,y,y’,y’’,\dots y^{n}) = 0
\end{gather}
$$
which is a nth order ODE. 
💡 - Analogously, in PDE’s a typically first order PDE looks like,
$$
\begin{gather}
f(x,y,u, u_{x},u_{y}) = 0
\end{gather}
$$
where PDEs related the independent variable, dependent variable, and the partial derivatives of the dependent variable.

In both cases, $f$ gives a relationship between the Ind and Dep variables as well as the derivatives (partial as well in the PDE case) of the Dep variable.

💡 - slightly random connection, but if there’s two ind variables in a DE, you automatically know its a PDE, because that would automatically imply your partially derivatating. 

With this said, $u = u(x)$ is a solution to the ODE on the interval $I$:  $\alpha<x<\beta$ if 
a. the derivatives of $u$ exist on $I$ $u’,u’’,\dots u^n$
b. $f(x,u,u’,u’’\dots,u^n)=0$ for all $x$ in $I$ 

Types of Solutions: 
We have three types of solutions: exact, numerical, and qualitative

1. An **exact** solution is a formula for the DE which we often do by hand
	1. $y’=x$ where our exact solution is $y = \frac{1}{2}x^{2}+C$. Our solution describes all functions that can solve this ODE which we call a **general solution**. When we choose the value for $C$, that refers to a **particular** solution of a DE. This demands that our solution equation passes through a specific point (such point being dictated by the value of $C$) A **one-parameter** family of solutions describes the number (in this case one) of integration constants in the solutions. This can be modeled by a set of **integral curves**

3. A numerical solution approximates an exact solution for specified values of $x$ (or the ind var) which we typically obtain by a computer
	1. 💡 - which I can connect to numerical relativity, which is mai!nly coding/computer based
4. A qualitative solution is a graphical/geometric representation of the solution which usually describes the overall behavior of the solution (without obtaining the exact or numerical solution)

Thus we can describe a differential equation as an **Initial Value Problem** or  **IVP**, with some initial condition. 
$$
\begin{gather}
\begin{cases}
y’ = f(x,y) \\
y(x_{0})=y_{0} \leftarrow \hspace{.5cm} \text{intial condition (IC)}
\end{cases} 
\end{gather}
$$
