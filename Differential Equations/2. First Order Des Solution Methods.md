We begin by revisiting the **Qualitative** Approach to FOODE (first order ODEs). 
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)
\end{gather}
$$
where the left side of the equation is the slope of the solution $y(x)$ at a point $(x,y)$. The right side of the equation is a function of both $x$ and $y$ that determines the slope of the solution. 

The key idea is that we want to see how the solution behaves before knowing it exactly or numerically. To do this, we can draw a line for each selected value of $(x,y)$ that represents the slope of the solution at that point. A graph of these lines forms a **direction field (slope field)**. Hereâ€™s an example, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{dy}{dx} = x^{2} + y^{2} \\ \
yâ€™(0,0) = 0 \\ \\
yâ€™(0,1) = 1 \\ \\
yâ€™(1,1) = 2 \\ \\
yâ€™(0,2) = 4
\end{gather}
$$
Hereâ€™s what our direction or slope field looks like,

Points for which the slopes are identical are called **isoclines**. An example is $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$. Because our differential equation resembles a circle, sets of isoclines are points a long a specific circle. If we want to find the **solution trajectory**, or what the solution looks like given a particular solution $y(x)$, we can connect coordinates such that, that curve passes through our desired point. That looks something like,

Letâ€™s work through another example: 
$$
\begin{gather}
xâ€™ = 2(x-1)(5-x)
\end{gather}
$$
For the $xâ€™=0$ case, the points $x$ that satisfies the equation above are called  **steady states, nullclines, or equilibrium solutions**. These points would be $x=1,5$.

Now, letâ€™s understand what the curves are like for the rest of the values of $x$, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\begin{cases}
x>5: xâ€™<0  \\
x<1: xâ€™<0 \\
1\leq x\leq 5: xâ€™>0
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$

ðŸ’¡ - starting at when $xâ€™=0$ and graphing that, and then finding out what $xâ€™$ looks like everywhere else is a good strategy to find the qualitative solution to a ODE!

Method of Separation of Variables

Separable ODEs can be written in the form 
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y)
\end{gather}
$$
and we can separate them like so, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{1}{(h(y))} dy = g(x)dx
\end{gather}
$$
and then we can integrate with respect to $y$ on the left and $x$ on the right. This looks like, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\int \frac{dy}{h(y)}  = \int g(x) \, dx  \\ \\ 
\ln(h) = \int g(x) \, dx +C 
\end{gather}
$$
ðŸ’¡ Side note: 
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{d}{dx} \int \frac{1}{h(y)} \frac{dy}{dx} \, dx  = \frac{d}{dx} \int \frac{1}{h(y)} dy = \frac{d}{dy} \left( \int \frac{1}{h(y)} dy \right) \frac{dy}{dx} \\ \\ = \frac{1}{h(y)} \frac{dy}{dx}
\end{gather}
$$
Informally, we separate the independent and dep variables to one side and integrate each side with respect to that variable. **Explicit solutions** have the dependent variable only on the left or right side shown once â€œ$y=$" raised to the first power. Letâ€™s think about the below DE where we want to find the particular solution given $y(0)=1$, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{dy}{dx}  = -\frac{x}{y}
\end{gather}
$$
This is a non linear DE because $y$ is raised to the $-1$. The explicit solution is, 
$$
\begin{gather}
y = \pm \sqrt{ -x^{2}+2(C) }
\end{gather}
$$
which each create a semi-circle (together a full circle). We can also rewrite this as
$$
\begin{gather}
y^{2}+x^{2} = r^{2}
\end{gather}
$$
where $r^{2}=2c$. The above form is called and **Implicit Solution** because our dependent variable is not isolated. We now use the initial condition, and plug it in
$$
\begin{gather}
1 = \sqrt{ r^{2} } = r \\ \\
1 = -\sqrt{ r^{2} } = -r
\end{gather}
$$
so $r$ can be either 1 or -1. Notice that if $r$ is -1 then our explicit solution is imaginary, so we donâ€™t want to keep that. Weâ€™ll thus take $r=1$ as our solution on the specified interval of $-1<x<1$ so that way we donâ€™t have an imaginary number as well. Such interval is called the **Interval of Existence** of the explicit solution for this IVP. 

Integrating factors: 

As we mentioned before, the normal form of a linear first order ODE is
$$
\begin{gather}
yâ€™ + p(x)y = g(x)
\end{gather}
$$
Our method of solution is multiplying $u$, the **integrating factor** to each term in the DE such that the ODE can be solved by direct integration.
