Faraday's Law: 

Moral: the magnetic field in both frames are essentially the same, as $\gamma$ are is very narrowly $>1$.

we have that the net force is 
$$
\begin{gather}
W = \oint f \cdot dl \ = qv (B_{1}-B_{2})w \\ \\ 
\varepsilon = \frac{W}{q}=v(B_{1}-B_{2})w \\ \\ 
\Phi = \int B\cdot \, da \dots d\Phi =-(B_{1}-B_{2})wvdt \\ \\ 

\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = -(B_{1}-B_{2})wv = \varepsilon \\ \\ 
\varepsilon = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt} \leftarrow \text{faraday's law}
\end{gather}
