### Electric Charge
Units of Charge -  1 (C) Coulumb 
- Charge is conserved (*Refer to Figure 2*)
	- only way charge can go into the cube is by measuring the partial rate $\frac{ \partial Q }{ \partial t }$ 
	- Cannot create or annihilate charge
	- Relativistically invariant
		- no matter what reference frame, charge is the same
	- Charge is quantized
		- comes in packets 

- Don't refer to figure one

What's an electric field (law of nature, Coulumbs law)  (*refer to Figure 3*)
- Definition: $$\mathbf{E} = \frac{Q}{r^{2}} \hspace{.5cm} \hspace{.5cm} \text{in coordinates of cartesian where: } \hspace{.5cm} r^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} \hspace{.5cm} E = \frac{Newtons}{Coul.}$$
- Next we think about the direction $\hat{r}$ radially everywhere(*refer to Figure 3*)
- has units$$F = qE \hspace{.5cm} Units: N$$
- Additionally we add $$\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{Q}{r^{2}} \text{ where} \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \approx 9 \times 10^9 mks$$
- The charge $q$ in the figure 3 has its own electric field. 

Math properties of electric field E:
- Line integral: $$
\begin{gather} 
\oint E \, dl 
\end{gather}
$$
- This equals Circulation (find the term for it )
- If we wanted to do a line integral around some path using $r_1$
- We identified the path on the figure 
	- We note that the path 1 on the circle = 0 as $E dl$ are perpandicular to each other 
	- The contribution of path two is $$\int -E \, dl $$
		- where there is pi angle between them
	- For path 3, it would also be zero 0. 
	- For the last path we do the integral from r1 to r2

		- $$ \int ^{r_{2}}_{{r_{1}}} E\, dl$$
	- We determine radial to be the linear paths and azimuthal to be the non-linear

Continuing with the properties of the electric field
- Circulation of the (related to the curl )
- $$
circulation = \oint E dl = 0
$$
- Flux (refer to figure 4)
- $$
\underbrace{ Flux = \int E \, dl }_{ \text{closed surface (No enclosed path)} } 
$$
Let's now think about the calculus of figure 5 
- The flux is defined over the any area, but let's focus on the closed surface
- the electric field for the rounded cube service 
	- $$ \begin{gather}
E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^2_{2}}\hat{r} \\ \\ 
\hat{r}\cdot da = \hat{r} \cdot \hat{r} = da \\ \\
\int _{I} \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^2_2}  \, da = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^2_2} A_{out} \\ \\ 
Flux = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \left[ \frac{A_{out}}{r^2_2} -\frac{A_{in}}{r^2_1} \right] = 0

 \end{gather}
$$

Exercise time!
Refer to figure 6

1. What is the electric field at the origin?
	1. it's zero because it cancels
		1. first instance of superposition
2. What is $E_x$ at y? 
	1. There is no x component as evident by symmetry 
3. What is $E_y$ at y?
	1. $$
\begin{gather} 
E = 2\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} + \frac{\cos\theta}{a^2 +y^2}
\end{gather}
$$
