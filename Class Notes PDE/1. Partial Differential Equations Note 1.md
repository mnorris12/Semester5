1. What is a PDE?
2. What are they good for?

1. Example
	1. a general PDE in variables $x_1......,x_n$ of order $\le 2$is a an equation in the form
$$
\begin{gather} 
F(x, u(x), u_{x_{i}}, u _{x_{1}x_{j}} (x) ) = 0 \\
x=(x_{1},\dots,X_{n})\\
U_{x_{i}} = \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x_{i} } \\
U_{x_{i}x_{j}} = \frac{ \partial ^2 }{ \partial x \partial x_{j} } \\

\end{gather}

$$
$$ \begin{gather} 
\text{Solution 1: A function u(x) satisfies this equation in a } \\ \\ 
F(x, z, y_{i}, t_{ij}) \\ \\
\text{where F is given, x is n, z is 1} \\ \\
\text{in function in } \\ \\
2n+1 + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\ \\
\text{ We want } \\ \\
0= F\left( x, u(x), \frac{ \partial u }{ \partial x_{i} }(x), \frac{ \partial ^2 }{ \partial x_{i} \partial x_{j} }(x)   \right) \\ \\ 
\end{gather}
$$
You can write every PDE as a system of ODEs

2. Many of the vast majority of models are described by PDEs 
	1. Newton used ODE for planetary motions
	2. It's natural to understand other natural phenomena using mathematics as a tool to describe them
	3. Data compression! 

There's a book by Courant -  Hilbert titled "Method of Mathematical Physics"
- it's in two volumes 
	- Volume 1 is highly recommended that you read through
	- Volume 2 most successful book written on Partial Differential Equations

Eleptic - eigenvalues have the same time

Wave equation: 
- a model of waves propagating in two dimensions
	- what does one mean by waves
		- transmission of signals 



1st order linear PDE (quasi-linear, but don't worry about that for now) 
- Linear - most straight forward
- semi-linear
- quasi-linear
- nonlinear
Let's illustrate a linear pde
$$
\begin{gather}
u_{x} + yu_{y}=0 \hspace{1cm} u(x,y) \\ \\ 
\text{Key observation: if  u satisfies the above equation, u(x,y) takes constant values of every curves satisfying } \\ \\ 
\frac{dx}{1} = \frac{dy}{1} \hspace{1cm} \text{meaning: a solution of the ODE which is equation} \\ \\ 
\begin{cases}
\frac{dx}{dt} = 1 \\
\frac{dy}{dt} = y \hspace{1cm} \text{linear but not homog.} 
\end{cases}

\end{gather}
$$
How to solve: 
$$
\begin{gather} 
\text{we would integrate both sides such that:} \hspace{1cm} x = \log y + C \\ \\
e^x = y + C' \\ \\ 
\dot{y}e^{-x} = C''

\end{gather}
$$
$$
\begin{gather} 
\frac{d}{dt} u(x(t), y(t)) = 
\end{gather}
$$
$$
\begin{gather}
u(x,y) = f(y e^{-x)})
\end{gather} \hspace{1cm} \text{ for some function of f(c) in one varible}
