Description: 
"Few people know and remember the war in Transnistria, and some do not even consider it a war. And it was a long time ago, and far away, and not with us. And yet it was a war. It is heavy, slow, bloody and senseless, like many other civil wars. The main character of the book is Russian by nationality. He is not even a native of these places, but he has lived in Moldova since childhood and became attached to this land, loved it as his homeland. And then, in the early 90s, he was told: "This is not your land, you are a stranger, get out of here!"
