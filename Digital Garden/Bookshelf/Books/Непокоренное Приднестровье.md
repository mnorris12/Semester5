"The book describes the historical background to the conflict in Transnistria, the annexation of Bessarabia by Romania in 1918-1939 and 1941-1944. The main subject of the study is the conflict between the Moldovan and Transnistrian authorities, which began in 1989 and developed into an armed confrontation in 1992.
