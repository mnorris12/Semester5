### A little about the creator:
Hello! My name is Marqualand Norris (although I go by Sora), and I'm a student at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, USA. My initial interests in Moldova began as a 21-22 NSLI-Y Academic Year Finalist where I intensively studied Russian in Chisinau, Moldova. I arrived back to the states, and the summer after my freshmen year (Currently a Sophomore, fall semester), I began to research with REEES (Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies) Think Tank, and I chose to focus on the voices of Transnistrian citizens during the Transnistrian War in the early '90s. During my research, I've crafted this Digital Garden, presented my research at the ASEEES November 2023 Convention in Philadelphia, PA and crafted a 10 page paper titled [[My Research Paper - A Struggling People The Impact of the Soviet Union’s Dissolution on Transnistria’s Public Sentiment of the Soviet Legacy]],  

### Description of the Digital Project
As mentioned above, in my research with the REEES Think Tank, we were to create a digital project to further emphasize our paper and to present the information in a new way. I've chosen to do a [Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), a digitized notebook that contains not only new information, but information presented in a new way. It's a Plugin (additional content/code one can download for non-core features of an application) I've used in Obsidian, an advanced note-taking app. The garden does well to combine several different forms of digital projects like timelines and maps (as well as many other features). I like to think of it as a unison of the different methods, in this case history, that represents a culmination of work. You could think of it as a information hub for others interested in the Transnistrian War or in need of several methods of resources.

### Caution files
Because this project is about war, it does include items that one may find very graphic and unpleasant. This includes real images of blood and dead bodies. All such files will be prefaced with a "Caution!!" heading and are included below. Please proceed at your own discretion.
- [[Bendery - The Unconquered Executed]]
- [[Dubassary - The Bleeding Wound of Transnistria]]

### What's to come?
The Digital Garden is still in the works! Here's a few more planned projects:
- Image gallery
- A discussion of the mind map (the graph with all the dots on it)
- Video gallery
The projects that have already been published may be updated with additional information!

### Acknowledgements
This has been an incredible research experience with the REEES Think Tank, so I'd first like to acknowledge the program organizers Dr. Cummings, Dr. Lugo de Fabritz, Dr. Rucker-Chang, and Dr. Goff. I'd also like to acknowledge my mentor Erin Hutchinson for her invaluable support in providing me guidance, help, and knowledge on this project. I'd like to thank Howard University for offering this program to minority students like myself. I'd also like to thank the head of the Swarthmore Russian Department, Professor Sibelan Forrester for her advisory with research credit.

Thank you all for making this experience as great as it was!
