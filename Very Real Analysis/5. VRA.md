With that being said, if $X$ and $Y$ are sets, a **function** is a rule that assigns each element in $X$ and element in $Y$. We say “a **function** from $X$ to $Y$”, or a function from $X$ into $Y$. The word **mapping** or **map** is often used instead of **function**. So to functions from $X$ to $Y$ are only equal if and only if for each element in $X$ it maps to the exact same element of $Y$. Colloquially, if the start and end points of the roads (functions) are the same, the roads are the same. 

Denoted usually in lower case, functions are statements like “$f$ is a function from $X$ to $Y$” and is often written as,
 $$
\begin{gather}
f: X \rightarrow Y
\end{gather}
$$
For any $x \in X$, the element in $Y$ that the function $f$ associates it with (the value of $f$ at $x$) is denoted $f(x)$. Thus if $g(x)=f(x)$ if and only if $g=f$ or they’re the same function. We say that $f$ maps $x$ into $f(x)$.

The rule that defines a function $f$ can be defined in various ways. One way that we commonly do in math is to use an equation, 
$$
\begin{gather}
f(x) = x^{3}+3x-2
\end{gather}
$$
we say that $f(x)$ is “a real valued function on $\mathbb{R}$”. I believe what that means is that if $f(x)$, which is a rule, can take real numbers from the set $X$ to other real numbers in the set $Y$, then it is a function on $\mathbb{R}$. Maybe even more importantly, the fact that $X$ and $Y$ are both the set of real numbers gives reason that the function that goes between them, is a real valued function on $\mathbb{R}$.

Another way to define a function is by graphing, where it’s possible of course. In fact, any subset of real numbers on a real number graph defines a function, provided that a vertical line intersects the subset only once. You can think of this as the vertical line test, or that we expect every real number in the set $X$, after applying the rule, to have a unique value in the set $Y$. 

We also keep in mind that functions don’t have to be practically computable or usable. Take for instance a function $f(x)$ that takes any real number from $X$ and determines the billionth decimal place. Also say that it takes the smallest billionth decimal place because $1.000=.9999$ and $0<9$. That seems simple right? for $1$ the billion decimal place is $0$ and for $.999\bar{9}$ the billionth decimal place is $9$. What if you needed $\pi$ though or $\sqrt{ 2 }$? You’d need to know the billionth digit of $\pi$, and that’s just not practical. However, that doesn’t mean that $f(x)$ isn’t a legit real valued function on $\mathbb{R}$ because it definitely is. 

To simply define the notion of a function, If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, and a function from $X$ into $Y$ is a subset of $X\times Y$, with the property that for each element $x \in X$, there’s a unique and singular $y \in Y$. $(x,y)$ is a subset of that function

Opposed to the complete concept of $f$ being a function “from $X$ into $Y$”, we can define it more primitively. It’s simply a ordered pair whose first member is an ordered pair ($X,Y$), and whose second member defines a function which is a subset of $X\times Y$. We say it like that because we want to highlight $X,Y$ and that they are the inputs and outputs of the function $f$. For example, if $f: X\rightarrow Y$, and $Y$ is a subset of $Y’$, then $f’:X\rightarrow Y’$ is the function we get when we set $f(x)’=f(x)$. Even though everything is a set, it may be easier to think of $f(x)$ as a rule, and $f$ as a set. We essentially want, for select elements in $X$, the graphs of $f(x)$ and $f(x)’$ to look the same. This is possible because
$$
\begin{gather}
X\times Y \subset X\times Y’
\end{gather}
$$
We note that in cases like these, there isn’t any confusion if we say $f:X\rightarrow Y’$.  

If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y \rightarrow Z$ are functions, we define the **composition of f and g**, or **composed function**, to be the function from $X$ to $Z$. You can intuit that you start in $X$ then go to $Y$, and from there, go to $Z$. We denote it $g \circ f$.  We have, 
$$
\begin{gather}
g \circ f: X \rightarrow Z
\end{gather}
$$
with $g \circ f(x) = g(f(x))$. for each $x\in X$. 

A function $f : A → B$ is one-to-one if for each $b ∈ B$ there is at most one $a ∈ A$ with $f(a) = b$. It is onto if for each $b ∈ B$ there is at least one $a ∈ A$ with $f(a) = b$. It is a one-to-one correspondence or bijection if it is both one-to-one and onto. Notice that “$f$ is one-to-one” is asserting uniqueness, while “$f$ is onto” is asserting existence. This gives us the idea of how to prove that functions are one-to-one and how to prove they are onto. 

Example 2: Show that the function $f : R → R$ given by $f(x) = 2x + 1$ is one-to-one and onto. 
- We don’t have to get into any difficult proofs, but using the horizontal line test, $f(x) =2x{+1}$, is a linear function. We already know that each $f(x)$ corresponds with a unique $x$, 

A function also may be one-to-one but not onto if each element in $X$  corresponds to a unique element in $Y$, but there are elements in $Y$ that don’t correspond to any elements in $X$.
