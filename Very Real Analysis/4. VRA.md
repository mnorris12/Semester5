Exercise: Prove that if $I$ and $S$ are sets and if for each $i \in I$ we have $X_{i} \subset S$, then $\mathcal{C}(\underbrace{ \cap }_{ i \in I }X_{i})= \underbrace{ \cup }_{ i \in I }(\mathcal{C}X_{i})$. 

Solution:  If $I$ and $S$ are sets and if for each $i \in I$, then $\mathcal{C}(\underbrace{ \cap }_{ i \in I }X_{i})$ is the set of every element $x \in$ $S$ and every element $x \not\in \underbrace{ \cap }_{ i\in I }X_{i}$ for all $X_{i}$. That is, every element  $x \not\in X_{i}$, $x\in S$, comprises the complement of the particular set $X_{i}$ or $\mathcal{C}X_{i}$. 

I’ll provide some tips for proof righting, but first I wanna think about it it in a very basic way. You can start off by saying that $i=1,2$ to make things more simpler. Now you only have to prove it for two sets, $X_{1},X_{2}$. Once proved for two, it’s much easier to provide for all $i\in I$. Here’s a graphic that should help,

- Tip 1: Although we said $x \in X_{i}$ earlier on, the book redefines $x$ so that $x \in S$ and $x \not\in \underbrace{ \cap }_{ i\in I }X_{i}$. To be careful here, you could just define the elements as $s$ that make up the sets on either side of the equal sign in the last part of the exercise. 
- Tip 2: We don’t use $I$ in the explanation, so you can take it out of the preliminary part of your proof. 
- Tip 3: This part “ $x \in$ $S$ and every element $x \not\in \underbrace{ \cap }_{ i\in I }X_{i}$" of your proof is spot on! I assume the $X_{i}$ part implies “for each $X_{i}$” as $X_{i}$ is the notation for one set, while the family of each of them is denoted by notation we’ve defined earlier  ($\begin{cases} X_{i}: i \in I\} \hspace{.5cm}\text{or} \hspace{.5cm} \begin{cases} X_{i}\}_{i \in I} \end{cases} \end{cases}$). That is the book doesn’t have the “for each $X_{i}$” part. 
- Tip 4: the book does use “for at least one” when doing step 3 of our proof  guide. You should try to use more wording in the brackets that defines specific sets. 


If we have two different objects $a$ and $b$, we can write them as an ordered pair or, 
$$
\begin{gather}
(a,b)
\end{gather}
$$
where we consider object $a$ first and then consider object $b$. Thus, the order matters. It’s in the name. Now this is different than the set $\{a,b\}$, which is a set of two elements $a$ and $b$, unless $a=b$, then it’s really one element. (keep in mind that everything is a set in set notation). Also, we can write the same set as $\{b,a\}$. That’s important because the order in which elements are listed in the set isn’t important like how it is when we talk about ordered pairs. 

We want to define ordered pairs in terms of sets. The thing set theory tries to do is define all of mathematics using just sets. Now this is honestly a bit tricky to wrap one’s head around, but i’m going to do it in the simplest way i can think of. We have that
$$
\begin{gather}
(a,b) = \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}
\end{gather}
$$
The point of ordered pair notation is that it’s ordered, or else we wouldn’t need it. So, to fulfill that point, this is one of the many set notations you can use so that the order is fulfilled. If order is fulfill then the following MUST be the case, 
$$
\begin{gather}
(a,b)= (c,d) \hspace{.2cm} \text{if and only if} \hspace{.2cm} a=c,b=d
\end{gather}
$$
Now, from that, why does $(a,b) = \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ notation work (or $(c,d) = \{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}$) satisfy ordered paris?  Let’s use a easy example of $1$ and $2$. Does the following hold true?
$$
\begin{gather}
\{\{1\},\{1,2\}\} = \{\{1\},\{2,1\}\}
\end{gather}
$$
Well, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\{1\} = \{1\} \hspace{.2cm} \text{and} \hspace{.2cm} \{1,2\} = \{2,1\}
\end{gather}
$$
but now $\{\{1\},\{2,1\}\}$ also equals $\{\{2,1\},\{1\}\}$ thus we should have that, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\{\{1\},\{1,2\}\} = \{\{2,1\},\{1\}\}
\end{gather}
$$
but we immediately see that $\{1\} \neq \{2,1\}$ unless $1=2$, which it doesn’t. Thus we’ve shown that 
$$
\begin{gather}
\text{if} \hspace{.2cm} a =\{1\} \hspace{.5cm}b=\{1,2\}  \hspace{.5cm} c=\{1\} \hspace{.5cm}d = \{2,1\} \\ \\
\text{then} \hspace{.2cm} (a,b) = (c,d) \hspace{.2cm} \text{but} \hspace{.2cm}(a,b) \neq(d,c)
\end{gather} 
$$
Thus, the order matters.

Moving on to **cartesian product** or just **product**. If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, we define their cartesian product $X\times Y$ It is the set of all ordered pairs where the first object is in $X$ and the second object is in $Y$. It’s set notation is, 
$$
\begin{gather}
X\times Y = \{(x,y): x \in X, y \in Y\}
\end{gather}
$$
As an example, ordinary rectangular or cartesian coordinates can be all defined by the product of $X$ and $Y$ axis. Here’s an example from the book, 

![[Pasted image 20240828165553.png|center|300]]

That is, if the figures on the $X$ axis sweeps up, and the ones on the $Y$ axis sweeps right, their intersection is the product. 

With that being said, if $X$ and $Y$ are sets, a **function** is a rule that assigns each element in $X$ and element in $Y$. We say “a **function** from $X$ to $Y$”, or a function from $X$ into $Y$. The word **mapping** or **map** is often used instead of **function**. So to functions from $X$ to $Y$ are only equal if and only if for each element in $X$ it maps to the exact same element of $Y$. Colloquially, if the start and end points of the roads (functions) are the same, the roads are the same. 

Denoted usually in lower case, functions are statements like “$f$ is a function from $X$ to $Y$” and is often written as,
 $$
\begin{gather}
f: X \rightarrow Y
\end{gather}
$$
For any $x \in X$, the element in $Y$ that the function $f$ associates it with (the value of $f$ at $x$) is denoted $f(x)$. Thus if $g(x)=f(x)$ if and only if $g=f$ or they’re the same function. We say that $f$ maps $x$ into $f(x)$.
