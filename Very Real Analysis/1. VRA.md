Real Analysis: The beginning

Purpose: Redo calculus correctly in a setting of sufficient generality to provide a reasonable foundation for advanced work in various branches of analysis
- I think throughout all my calculus classes, there's been a limit on the ability to understand what's really happening that's been masked by complex algebra. Maybe what this is refering to is being general and all inclusive to properly define what calculus aims to do. 

Some Key Concepts: metric spaces, compactness, and uniform convergence

#### Chapter 1: Set Theory 

“Set theory is the language of mathematics”

###### $\S 1. \hspace{.2cm} \text{Sets and Elements. Subsets}$
We don’t attempt to strictly define what a set means. You can basically think of it as a collection or family of different elements. A set itself, can contain sets. That is, elements of a set can also be sets. We shall use capital letters to denote sets and lower case letters to denote elements: 
$$
\begin{gather}
x \in S \\ 
x\not\in S
\end{gather}
$$
The second line says that $x$ is not an element of the set $S$. Now, if we want to say that a set is completely **determined** by it’s elements, here’s an example: “If $X$ and $Y$ are sets then $X=Y$ if and only if, for all $x,x\in X$ if and only if $x \in Y$.”
My interpretation of this sentence: We know all the properties of a set, if it’s equal to another set, and everything about it, if we know those elements. This maybe should attest that the meat of these ideas are the elements themselves. Don’t think to hard on the sets, but instead, their elements. $x \in Y$ is a requirement that must be true if $x \in X$ for all $x$. This tells us that $X=Y$. We sometimes indicate that we have a set with braces {}: 
$$
\begin{gather}
\{\text{Jane, Jim}\}
\end{gather}
$$
Also, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\{1,2,3\dots\}
\end{gather}
$$
is the set of all positive integers where $\dots$ specifies “and so on”. Frequently used notation of a set is 
$$
\begin{gather}
\{x: \hspace{.2cm} \text{statement involving x}\}
\end{gather}
$$
which means the set of all $x$ for which the statement that involves $x$ is true. Thus, as an example, we could say, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\{x: x \hspace{.2cm} \text{is a positive integer}\}
\end{gather}
$$
which also denotes the set of all positive integers. For any set $S$ we have 
$$
\begin{gather}
S = \{x: \text{x}\in S\}
\end{gather}
$$
which defines the set $S$. Thus, the following notations are equivalent, 
$$
\begin{gather}
S = \{x\in S \hspace{.2cm}\text{(statement involving x)}\} \hspace{.5cm} \\ \\= \hspace{.5cm}\{ x: x \in S \hspace{.2cm}\text{and (statement involving x)}\}
\end{gather}
$$
which is pretty cool. If $R$ is the set of all real numbers, and we have the following set: 
$$
\begin{gather}
\{x \in R: x^{3}=1\}
\end{gather}
$$
then that set is equal to this set
$$
\begin{gather}
\{1,-1\}
\end{gather}
$$
as $x=1,-1$ are the only integers that satisfy or statement. If $X,Y$ are sets, and every element $x$ in the set $X$ exists in the set $Y$ then we say that $X$ is a **subset** of $Y$. Its notation looks like, 
$$
\begin{gather}
X \subset Y \hspace{.5cm} \text{or} \hspace{.5cm} Y \supset X
\end{gather}
$$
As I understand, both are equivalent. The second variation is called a **supset**. $X \subset Y$ is a shorthand way of mathematically saying that if $x \in X$ then $x \in Y$. Also, if $X \subset Y$ and $Y \subset Z$ then $X \subset Z$. That can be written as, 
$$
\begin{gather}
X \subset Y \subset Z 
\end{gather}
$$
On a other hand, the negation or other case where $X$ is not a subset of Y, then the notation is as follows,
$$
\begin{gather}
X \not\subset Y \hspace{.5cm} \text{or} \hspace{.5cm} Y \not\supset X
\end{gather}
$$
If $X \subset Y$ but $X \neq Y$, then $X$ is called a **proper subset** of $Y$. The empty set, a set with no elements inside, is denoted by $\emptyset$. One thing to be careful of, is not to consider the empty set nothing, it itself is something. For instance, if we have, although we probably wont see this very often, $\{ \emptyset \}$, then we have a set that contains one element, the empty set. In the same vain, we must not consider 0 nothing. It is also something. It is a number that defines the number of things in the empty set. Something that’s pretty cool, is for any set $X$, any at all, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\emptyset \subset X \hspace{.5cm} \text{and} \hspace{.5cm} X \subset X
\end{gather}
$$
and as a usage of those two simultaneously, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\emptyset \subset \emptyset
\end{gather}
$$
It’s important to point out, both in your literature and in speech, that $\emptyset \subset \emptyset$ is not saying $\emptyset$ is contained in $\emptyset$. While the statement portion is true, the notation shouldn’t be confused with $\emptyset \in \emptyset$.  $\emptyset \subset \emptyset$ means that the empty set is a subset of the empty set. “For each $x \in \emptyset$ we have $x \in \emptyset$ is obviously true, and also because it is “vacuously true””. Vacuously means that because the condition cannot be met, then there’s no counter example, so it’s vacuously true. More specifically, the book says “all pigs with wings speak Chinese” is vacuously true. Since you can’t bring me a pig with wigs that doesn’t speak Chinese (because you can’t bring me a pig with wings), then stating all pigs with wings speak Chinese must be true.
###### $\S\hspace{.2cm} \text{2.  Operations on Sets.}$  

The **intersection** of two sets $X,Y$ is denoted by $X \cap Y$ which is defined to be the set of all elements which are in both $X,Y$. This can be additionally written as, 
$$
\begin{gather}
X \cap Y = \begin{cases}
x: x \in X \hspace{.2cm} \text{and} \hspace{.2cm}x \in Y
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
The **union** of $X,Y$ is denoted $X \cup Y$. It is a set in which, all the elements of $X$ or all the elements of $Y$, or both are included. This can be written as. 
$$
\begin{gather}
X \cup Y = \begin{cases}
x: x \in X \hspace{.2cm} \text{or} \hspace{.2cm}x \in Y
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
Note that “or” in mathematics refers to *not* that one or the other has to be true, but that one, the other, or both, have to be true. 

We have that the **complement** in a set $S$ is the set of all elements in $S$ for which are not in the set $X$. It’s called the **complement of X** and accompanies or complements $X$ to complete $S$. The notion is $\mathcal{C}X$.  $\mathcal{C}$
