###### $\S\hspace{.2cm} \text{2.  Operations on Sets.}$  

The **intersection** of two sets $X,Y$ is denoted by $X \cap Y$ which is defined to be the set of all elements which are in both $X,Y$. This can be additionally written as, 
$$
\begin{gather}
X \cap Y = \begin{cases}
x: x \in X \hspace{.2cm} \text{and} \hspace{.2cm}x \in Y
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
The **union** of $X,Y$ is denoted $X \cup Y$. It is a set in which, all the elements of $X$ or all the elements of $Y$, or both are included. This can be written as. 
$$
\begin{gather}
X \cup Y = \begin{cases}
x: x \in X \hspace{.2cm} \text{or} \hspace{.2cm}x \in Y
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
Note that “or” in mathematics refers to *not* that one or the other has to be true, but that one, the other, or both, have to be true. 

We have that the **complement** in a set $S$ is the set of all elements in $S$ for which are not in the set $X$. It’s called the **complement of X** and accompanies or complements $X$ to complete $S$. The notion is $\mathcal{C}X$.  That is, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\mathcal{C}X = \begin{cases}
x \in S: x\not\in X
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
Here’s a visual to help understand the last three terms

The shaded regions are the sets that the notion defines. Certain relations hold between the three notions $\cap,\cup,\mathcal{C}$. Here’s an example, if $X$ and $Y$ are subsets of a set $S$, then, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\mathcal{C}X \cap \mathcal{C}Y = \mathcal{C}(X \cup Y)
\end{gather}
$$
This says the intersection of the complement of $X$ and the complement of $Y$ is the same as the complement of the union of $X$ and $Y$. Let’s break that down. The set we care about is all the elements in $S$ that is a combination of the stuff outside of $X$ and the stuff outside of $Y$. Here, “stuff” means elements. That is equal to all the elements outside of $X$ or Y, but in $S$ (remember “or” here means one, the other, and both). The book asks us for a proof, and this is what my brain is thinking after reading theirs,

This doesn’t exactly make sense just looking at it, but here’s the idea. Start by using the preliminary information in the questions. Then start on the left side of the equal sign. Break it down and *explain* what it means. Next you are going to connect it to the right side of the equation by *rewriting* the right side using what you’ve said to break down the left. Then you state the right side of the equation exactly. That’s half of it. You then do the exact same thing now, but starting from the right side of the equation. Here’s a numbered guide: 
1. Start proof by using preliminary info in exercise
2. Explain left side
3. Connect left and right side by rewriting left using your explanation of the right. 
4. State the right side. It should be fully implied by step three in which there’s no explanation gaps!
5. Repeat 2-4 going the other way around!
Tips: use the language in the brackets that are used to define sets verbatim!

If $X$ and $Y$ are subsets of $S$, the notation $X-Y$ is sometimes used for all the elements in $S$ that are in $X$ but not in $Y$. The notation looks like
$$
\begin{gather}
\begin{cases}
x \in X: x \not\in Y
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
This is the same as $X \cap \mathcal{C}Y$. Here’s a picture to illustrate,

The notation above describes only what’s green. That is, elements that are in $X$, but also in $Y$ are *not* included in $X-Y$.

Two sets are said to be **disjointed** if they don’t have any elements in common. This can be written as $X \cap Y=\emptyset$. 

If we want to include more than two sets, the notation is intuitive, 

$$
\begin{gather}
X \cap Y\cap Z = \begin{cases}
x: x \in X, x \in Y, x \in Z
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
and 
$$
\begin{gather}
X \cup Y \cup Z = \begin{cases}
x: x \in X  \text{ or} \hspace{.2cm} x \in Y \text{ or} \hspace{.2cm}x \in Z
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
