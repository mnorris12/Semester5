Two sets are said to be **disjointed** if they don’t have any elements in common. This can be written as $X \cap Y=\emptyset$. 

If we want to include more than two sets, the notation is intuitive, 

$$
\begin{gather}
X \cap Y\cap Z = \begin{cases}
x: x \in X, x \in Y, x \in Z
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
and 
$$
\begin{gather}
X \cup Y \cup Z = \begin{cases}
x: x \in X  \text{ or} \hspace{.2cm} x \in Y \text{ or} \hspace{.2cm}x \in Z
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
❔ - On page 6, the text book says, “A collection of any. number of sets is said to be disjoint if every two of the sets are disjoint”. Does this mean that if I have a collection of, say, 8 sets, then if 4 pairs of them are disjoint, the family of sets are disjoint? Essentially, what are the conditions for a family of sets to be disjoint? 

When we are working with a family of sets, it’s generally not a problem to describe, maybe in words, what is or isn’t inside the family. The challenging part arrises with finding adequate notation that describes the family. Here’s how we might find the notation: Let’s take some set $I$ and say its elements are indices $i$. For each index $i$, allow $X_{i}$ to be a set with index $i$. We do this so that way we can talk about $I$ as an indexing family, in which a particular set we care about, $X_{i}$ is specified by the index, $i$. That is $I$ tells us how many sets $X$ there are, and its elements tells us which specific set $X_{i}$ we care about. $X_{i}$ are not sets in $I$, I just specifies which set $X_{i}$. We denote that by, 
$$
\begin{gather}
\begin{cases}
X_{i}: i \in I\} \hspace{.5cm}\text{or} \hspace{.5cm} \begin{cases}
X_{i}\}_{i \in I}
\end{cases}
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$
If we want to define the intersection and union of these two sets in the same way, they are as follows, 
$$
\begin{gather} 
\text{intersection:} \hspace{.5cm}
\underbrace{ \cap }_{ i \in I } X_{i} = \begin{cases}
x: \text{for each} \hspace{.5cm} i \in I, x \in X_{i} \} 
\end{cases} \\ \\ 
\text{Union:} \hspace{.5cm}
\underbrace{ \cup }_{ i \in I } X_{i} = \begin{cases}
x: \text{for at least one} \hspace{.5cm} i \in I, x \in X \}
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
$$

🤔 - I think when we say intersection for the first notation, $x \in X_{i}$ means $x\in X_{1}$ and $x \in X_{2}$ and $x \in X_{3}$ and so on. 
💡 - When reading the notation in brakets (so what’s on the right side of the equation), try thinking of it this way: “each element $x$ such that” $\rightarrow$ $\{x:\dots$  where “:” would be “such that”. You would then say $x \in X_{i}$ $\rightarrow$  “that element is in the set $X_{i}$”. Thus, you can think of $\{x: \text{for each} \hspace{.2cm}i \in I, x \in X\}$ as “each element $x$ such that, that element is in the set $X_{i}$”. I think this description makes it makes sense. 

Exercise: Prove that if $I$ and $S$ are sets and if for each $i \in I$ we have $X_{i} \subset S$, then $\mathcal{C}(\underbrace{ \cap }_{ i \in I }X_{i})= \underbrace{ \cup }_{ i \in I }(\mathcal{C}X_{i})$. 

Solution:  If $I$ and $S$ are sets and if for each $i \in I$, then $\mathcal{C}(\underbrace{ \cap }_{ i \in I }X_{i})$ is the set of every element $x \in$ $S$ and every element $x \not\in \underbrace{ \cap }_{ i\in I }X_{i}$ for all $X_{i}$. That is, every element  $x \not\in X_{i}$, $x\in S$, comprises the complement of the particular set $X_{i}$ or $\mathcal{C}X_{i}$. 
$\mathcal{C}(X_{1} \cap X_{2})$
$\cup(\mathcal{C}X_{1},\mathcal{C}X_{2})$


- Tip 1: Although we said $x \in X_{i}$ earlier on, the book redefines $x$ so that $x \in S$ and $x \not\in \underbrace{ \cap }_{ i\in I }X_{i}$. To be careful here, you could just define the elements as $s$ that make up the sets on either side of the equal sign in the last part of the exercise. 
- Tip 2: We don’t use $I$ in the explanation, so you can take it out of the preliminary part of your proof. 
- Tip 3: This part “ $x \in$ $S$ and every element $x \not\in \underbrace{ \cap }_{ i\in I }X_{i}$" of your proof is spot on! I assume the $X_{i}$ part implies “for each $X_{i}$” as $X_{i}$ is the notation for one set, while the family of each of them is denoted by notation we’ve defined earlier  ($\begin{cases} X_{i}: i \in I\} \hspace{.5cm}\text{or} \hspace{.5cm} \begin{cases} X_{i}\}_{i \in I} \end{cases} \end{cases}$). That is the book doesn’t have the “for each $X_{i}$” part. 
- Tip 4: the book does use “for at least one” when doing step 3 of our proof  guide. You should try to use more wording in the brackets that defines specific sets.
